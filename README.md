# Disability_in_india
A brief data analysis on a self curated data on the disabled population in India compared by state using SQL, Python and Tableau.

There are more than 26.8 million people or 2.2% of the population currently who have disabilities in India (Census 2011) which itself is said to be a very conservative estimate. There is a lot of stigma associated with the disabled community and a very high inequality in terms of social as well as monetary status between the disabled community and the entire population.
